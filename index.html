			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/FullSizeRender.jpg" class="WhitneyPhoto">

			<p>Making Chicago my home 14 years ago was one of the best decisions I've ever made. It's brought me to career that's helped shape me into a more responsible adult. Chicago has also gifted me a community that is more like family than friends. It's also where my love for yoga and travel truly started to flourish.</p>
			
			<p2>Now I find myself on my newest adventure in the world of coding. It's exciting and daunting at the same time. It reminds of when I started playing
			tennis at 9 years old and being totally intimidated by everyone around me. I realize that in order to become great at something new you have to show up and suck first. I'm ready and looking forward to the challenges ahead.</p2>
